A multiplatform program to create fictional solar systems, Diaspora Custers and starmaps 2300AD-style

It's written in C++ using multiplatform QT Libraries ( http://qt.nokia.com ) 

It has been developed on a windows machine using Mingw as compiler and QTCreator as ide. 

With the same setup (QT+QTCreator) I compiled this program under Ubuntu 10.x and OSX Leopard. 
Binaries for OSX have also been tested on OSX Snow Leopard.
